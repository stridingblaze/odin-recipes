    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is from Saz칩n Boricua, the cooking blog of my Puerto Rican friend 
        Jeannette Qui침ones-Cantore. When I saw the picture, I immediately thought why did 
        not I think of this before? I have it on my to-do list, but I decided to share it 
        right now because such a delight cannot wait! Keep reading for Jeanette's full 
        recipe.</p>
    
    <p>Jeannette said this lasagna or pastel칩n is connected to her childhood because it 
        was a recipe that her mam치 used to prepare. Served with plain white rice and a 
        green salad, this lasagna makes a full yummy meal. Following is the recipe.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 or 6 ripe plantains, peeled</li>
